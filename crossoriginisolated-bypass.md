## crossOriginIsolated bypass (Awarded $3000)
Crashing tabs may cause bugs like [restrictions](https://web.dev/why-coop-coep/) being bypassed (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1226909),
This abused a different bug that allowed crashing a tab of any origin or the browser (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1169844) such issues don't seem to be considered security bugs.
