# RenderProcessHost and StoragePartition

This page details the relationship between `RenderProcessHostImpl` and `StoragePartitionImpl`, and how storage partitioning affects process allocation and security.

## Storage Partition Overview

A `StoragePartition` is a logical grouping of storage APIs, such as cookies, local storage, IndexedDB, and the Cache API. Each `BrowserContext` can have multiple `StoragePartition`s, and each `RenderProcessHost` is associated with a single `StoragePartition`.

The `StoragePartition` is used to isolate data between different sites and origins, preventing them from accessing each other's data. This is a key aspect of site isolation and helps to improve security and privacy.

## `RenderProcessHostImpl` and `StoragePartitionImpl`

The `RenderProcessHostImpl` class has a member variable `storage_partition_impl_` which is a `WeakPtr` to the `StoragePartitionImpl` object associated with the `RenderProcessHost`. This pointer is set during the construction of the `RenderProcessHostImpl` object and is used to access various storage-related services.

## Storage Partition and Process Allocation

When a new `RenderProcessHost` is needed for a navigation, the `GetProcessHostForSiteInstance` method in `RenderProcessHostImpl` considers the `StoragePartition` of the `SiteInstance` when determining whether an existing process can be reused or a new process needs to be created.

The `InSameStoragePartition` method is used to check if a given `StoragePartition` is the same as the one used by the `RenderProcessHost`. This check ensures that a `RenderProcessHost` is not reused for a `SiteInstance` that belongs to a different `StoragePartition`.

## Storage Partition and Security

The association between a `RenderProcessHost` and a `StoragePartition` is crucial for enforcing site isolation and preventing data leaks between different sites and origins. By ensuring that each renderer process is associated with a single `StoragePartition`, Chromium can guarantee that a renderer process can only access data that belongs to the sites and origins within that partition.

## Storage Partition and Mojo Interfaces

`RenderProcessHostImpl` interacts with the `StoragePartitionImpl` to provide access to various storage-related Mojo interfaces, such as:

-   `CacheStorage`
-   `IndexedDB`
-   `FileSystemManager`
-   `FileSystemAccessManager`
-   `FileBackedBlobFactory`
-   `RestrictedCookieManager`
-   `QuotaManagerHost`
-   `LockManager`

These interfaces are bound to the renderer process and allow it to interact with the storage APIs in a secure and isolated manner.

-   The interaction between `RenderProcessHostImpl`, `StoragePartitionImpl`, and other storage-related components, such as `IndexedDBContext` and `CacheStorageContext`.
-   The impact of storage partitioning on process allocation and site isolation.
-   The handling of special cases, such as guests and extensions, which may have different storage partitioning requirements.
