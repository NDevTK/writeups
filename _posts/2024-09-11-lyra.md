title:  lyra.horse XSS
---

`lyra.horse` is a website used for hosting personal projects from <https://x.com/rebane2001/> such as [antonymph](https://lyra.horse/antonymph) and [blog](https://lyra.horse/blog).

# The XSS

One of the tools originally shown at the [XS-Leaks](https://xsleaks.dev/) event 2024, Organized by [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) is [XS Frame Counter](https://lyra.horse/tools/frame-counter/) that does frame counting for [XS-Leaks](https://xsleaks.dev/) except when [COOP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) stops it.

Unfortunately the untrusted URL from `<input>` was directly used in a call to `window.open` :(

```js
function start(url) {
  windowClosed = false;
  startTime = Date.now();
  frameRefs.length = 0;
  activeFrames.length = 0;
  frameCount = 0;
  currentFrame = 0;
  log(`Loading ${url}...`);
  currentWindow = window.open(url, 'xspanel', 'popup');
  currentWindow.onload = () => {
    log(`Loaded at ${Date.now() - startTime}...`);
  };
}
```

This means by social engineering the victim to click anywhere on the attacker page,

```js
onclick = () => {
  navigator.clipboard.writeText('javascript:alert(1337)');
};
```

Then clicking to focus the hidden iframes `<input>` element and doing `ctrl v` (to paste the payload),  
...Now just trick the victim into doing one more click on the hidden `go` button to get XSS.

This was fixed in <https://github.com/rebane2001/lyra.horse/commit/368bc771a9f61ca2ed4001878b8c93d190a589c9> by adding a whitelist... I mean allowlist for the `http:` and `https:` protocol. Importantly they added a duck emoji to ensure it won't happen again.

# The impact

At first glance it may appear that this site is static, you wouldn't be able to do much with the self XSS anyways however as mentioned above this website also includes a service called [antonymph](https://lyra.horse/antonymph) that requests MIDI permission and to open unlimited popups, which can be abused by attackers.

# Justification

While having this writeup could be pointless in terms of impact and unlikely user interaction, it does not require a compromised renderer and promotes xs-leaks.
