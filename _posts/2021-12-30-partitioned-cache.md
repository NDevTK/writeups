title: Partitioned HTTP Cache Bypass (Not fixed)
---

Does not use the initiator, treating it as a bug until someone complains. [(Navigations | XS-Leaks Wiki)](https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#partitioned-http-cache-bypass)  
This allows a cache based XS-Search on websites when same-site resources are used based on the search query controlled by the attacker.
