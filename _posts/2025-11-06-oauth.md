title: OAuth redirects don't check for https:// protocol (WONTFIX)
---

OAuth redirects <https://notebooks.cloud.google.com/static/oauth.html> and <https://developerconnect.google.com/redirect> appear to preform no protocol checks allowing for network attackers to leak tokens.  
It's a less cool <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2.1> variant of <https://bughunters.google.com/reports/vrp/wG2bN8vZr> for network attackers.



# Requirements:
- User trusts the Google Cloud Developer Connect Account Connector OAuth app on GitHub this has `Full control of private repositories`  
By following the normal HTTPS OAuth flow and redirection.
> At the time of report this could be done on <https://codeassist.google.com/agents-tools> but that feature has since gone.
- The user is on a public network.

# User steps:
- User gets automatically redirected to an attacker captive portal (Normal secure non-google looking website)
- User taps accept cookies for popup (User activation)

# Attacker script steps:
- That attacker page then does two things: it opens a popup and redirects the now hidden tab to `http://unsafe.codeassist.google.com/` that's over an insecure connection and controlled by the attacker.
- Attacker controlled `http://unsafe.codeassist.google.com/` uses its post message listener to steal the secret OAuth URL via `window.onmessage`
> GitHub doesn't support the implicit grant type but it's likely using the <https://codeassist.google.com/api/finishoauth> method same as the previous VRP report.
- The popup gets redirected to the attacker modified OAuth URL with its custom `state` value <https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloperconnect.google.com%2Fredirect&client_id=Ov23liuPPgjf25D65gXP&scope=repo&state=%7B%22origin%22%3A%22http%3A%2F%2Funsafe.codeassist.google.com%22%7D>
> Since the attacker is not asking for any new permissions despite the URL parameters changing, this OAuth flow does not prompt the user for consent.

# Reasoning for WONTFIX 
"We've reviewed your report, and it seems the attack you've outlined relies on a few unlikely conditions. For this to work, a user would need to be on a malicious network and then actively click through redirects to an attacker-controlled site. We're also not clear on how a user would initially be directed to this malicious website.

Given these factors, we won't be tracking this as a security vulnerability."

The Chromium team are planning on enabling HTTPS by default for Chrome 154 in October 2026 <https://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/https-by-default.html>
