title: crossOriginIsolated bypass (Awarded $3000)
---

Crashing tabs may cause bugs like [restrictions](https://web.dev/why-coop-coep/) being bypassed [Issue 40056434](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40056434),
This abused a different bug that allowed crashing a tab of any origin or the browser [Issue 40744131](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40744131) such issues don't seem to be considered security bugs.
