title: Google XSS part 2
---

The following abuse `CVE-2024-4367 â€“ Arbitrary JavaScript execution` in `PDF.js` affecting versions <= 4.1.392 the exploit authors have documented this attack very well at <https://codeanlabs.com/blog/research/cve-2024-4367-arbitrary-js-execution-in-pdf-js/>

This dependency was fixed in <https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/18015>  
Multiple PDF Viewers have had an XSS <https://github.com/luigigubello/PayloadsAllThePDFs> issue.

# Project Baseline XSS (baseline.google.com) $3133.70

This is a service used for clinical research.  
Endpoint with the bug is a PDF Viewer hosted at `https://baseline.google.com/member/mobilepdf?url=<PDF>` where` <PDF>` is a URL that goes to a custom PDF with CORS. This was found by searching the source code of their Android Apps.
For example with `https://baseline.google.com/member/mobilepdf?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NDevTK/cross-site/main/CVE-2024-4367.pdf&hl=en-US` I get a alert that says my google baseline cookies since the file has `/FontMatrix [1 2 3 4 5 (1\); alert\(document.cookie)]`  
The URL parameter appears to no longer work.

# SignalPath XSS (app.signalpath.com) $100

Like above but older PDF.js version `https://app.signalpath.com/trialpath/assets/pdfjs/web/viewer.html`  
There is a same-origin or blob check for the file URL parameter, However the open file feature results in XSS (it also works by drag and drop)  
May also be a feature in Site CTMS to upload a document containing the XSS, for example to gain privilege escalation.  
To make the attack less obvious since `app.signalpath.com` has no embed protection you can make it look like the file upload is for an unrelated site.  
This was fixed by updating to `4.8.69`
