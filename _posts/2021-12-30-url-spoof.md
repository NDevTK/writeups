title: URL Spoof (Awarded $1000)

By crashing a cross-origin pop-up then navigating it to data:html,foo which gets blocked, The URL would stay cross-site but the page would be same-origin.
[Issue 40054631](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40054631)  
This was duplicate but made a good twitter background.

Later there was a ghost image issue where the page stayed cross-origin but the contents of the previous page showed.  
[Issue 40057561](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40057561)

This attack was migrated by needing to crash cross-site, however [Issue 40054631](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40054631) had a way to do it.  
And any extension can crash any tab [Issue 40848497](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40848497) similar to the [crossOriginIsolated bypass](https://ndevtk.github.io/writeups/2021/12/30/crossoriginisolated-bypass/)
