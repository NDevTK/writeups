title: Email storage leaking ticket-attachments (Awarded $5000)
---
As part of the Google VRP reward process I received a Google Ticket acknowledgment email from “Google GUTS” this email had an image embedded from [https://storage.googleapis.com/guts/](https://storage.googleapis.com/guts/) when visiting directly I noticed listing was enabled and I saw [https://storage.googleapis.com/guts/ticket-attachments/](https://storage.googleapis.com/guts/ticket-attachments/) that I then reported.
