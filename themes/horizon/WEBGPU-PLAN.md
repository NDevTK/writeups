# Horizon WebGPU port — engineering plan

The goal: move Horizon.html from WebGLRenderer to three.js
WebGPURenderer with the research passes (Hillaire atmosphere LUTs,
Nubis cloud march, irradiance integral) running as real compute
shaders — the way the papers themselves run — while keeping the WebGL2
path working for browsers without WebGPU.

## Ground rules (do not relax these to "finish" a phase)

- **No approximations to make it run.** If a subsystem cannot port
  cleanly inside a session, it stays on the working renderer until it
  can. A phase is done when the harness matrix is green, not when it
  compiles.
- **Every phase ends with the full validation matrix** (below) and,
  where the phase claims visual equivalence, a numeric A/B against the
  previous phase (mean abs pixel diff, with the stochastic
  temporal-cloud region excluded or accounted for; phase 1 measured
  3.5/255 mean with 96% of outliers in cloud sky).
- **One phase per commit series, plan updated in the same push.** The
  Status section below is the hand-off between sessions.

## Phases

1. **DONE — three r160 → r185** (commit `d001eea`). Modern three
   splits the build: `three.module.min.js` imports
   `./three.core.min.js`; both are vendored. Sky/Water/CSM examples
   re-vendored at the same tag (Water patch target strings and CSM API
   byte-checked before the swap).
2. **WebGPURenderer on its WebGL backend.** Vendor
   `build/three.webgpu.js` (+ `three.tsl.js`). `onBeforeCompile` does
   not exist there, so every material hook becomes TSL node material
   code:
   - terrain (TERRAIN_GLSL: per-pixel material from the DEM normal
     map, sea normals/spec, roughness) → `MeshStandardNodeMaterial`
     with `colorNode`/`normalNode`/`roughnessNode`
   - aerial-perspective fog hook (all world materials) → shared TSL
     fog node sampling the aerial LUT
   - CSM → `CSMShadowNode` (three has a node-based CSM)
   - Water/Sky → `WaterMesh`/`SkyMesh` from `examples/jsm/objects/`
     (TSL versions); re-apply the Cox-Munk/whitecap/surf physics as
     node code — the physics itself must not be simplified
   - atmosphere/cloud passes can initially stay as fragment-style
     passes via `TextureNode` render targets
     Acceptance: full matrix on the WebGL backend, A/B vs phase 1.
3. **WebGPU backend + compute.** Enable WebGPU (feature-detect,
   WebGL2 fallback stays):
   - transmittance / multiple-scattering / sky-view / aerial /
     irradiance LUT chain → compute shaders writing storage textures
   - Nubis march → compute at quarter res (same Bayer temporal
     reconstruction; storage-texture ping-pong)
   - irradiance readback → async staging-buffer read
     (`readRenderTargetPixelsAsync`), removing the 1 Hz sync stall
     Acceptance: matrix on WebGPU AND on the WebGL2 fallback.
4. **Post-port improvements** (each still paper-sourced): blue-noise
   march jitter (Ulichney / void-and-cluster) replacing the hash,
   sky-view LUT horizon-band fix (Bruneton parameterization near the
   horizon), motion-vector history for a translating camera if the
   free camera ever animates positionally.

## Validation matrix (offline fixture harness)

Rebuild recipe: copy the site into a scratch dir as
`site/writeups/themes/…`, rewrite the terrarium URL to local
`/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` fixtures (Grindelwald 46.62,8.04 z12 and
Nelson −41.27,173.28 z12), inject a fetch stub before the module
script that serves OSM Overpass fixtures by URL suffix and rejects
everything else (stars.json / constellations / rapier pass through to
disk), serve with `python3 -m http.server`, and shoot with headless
Chromium `--use-angle=swiftshader --virtual-time-budget=N
--screenshot` (console via `--enable-logging=stderr`, state probes via
`window.__dbg` → `document.title`).

Scenes (all at Grindelwald unless noted):

- noon clear (`cloud=25…code=2`) — aerial blues, GGX terrain, CSM
- sunset 19:10 — alpenglow from transmitted direct sun only
- night 2026-06-29T22:30 — stars, constellations, 6-px
  Lommel-Seeliger moon (flat disc, ~172–177 luminance across)
- stratus `code=3`, cumulus `code=2`, towering `code=95` decks
- Nelson sea — Water patch compiles, Cox-Munk glitter
- snowfall `temp=-3&code=73&snow=2` — Rapier loads, flakes fall
- aurora, Reykjavik winter night `aurora=0.85&auroralat=67` (an oval
  at the observer's own latitude is _correctly_ at the zenith and out
  of frame — not a bug)
- scripted free-camera flight (synthetic pointer drag + KeyW)

## Status

- Phase 1 complete (r185 vendored, matrix green, A/B 3.5/255).
- Phase 2 in progress:
  - `three.webgpu.min.js` + `three.tsl.min.js` vendored at r185;
    WebGPURenderer boots on the WebGL2 backend in the harness
    (`forceWebGL: true`, `await renderer.init()`,
    `renderer.backend.isWebGLBackend`).
  - Terrain material ported: `terrain-tsl.js` exports
    `createTerrainNodeMaterial(normalMapTex, aerialLutTex)` — the
    complete GLSL logic as node code (noise, DEM normal map,
    grass/rock/snow/sea with asinh elevation inversion,
    Pierson-Moskowitz sea normals, Blinn+Schlick glitter as
    emissiveNode, Monahan whitecaps, per-pixel roughnessNode, aerial
    LUT + Koschmieder outputNode). Unit-validated on the WebGL
    backend: altitude bands with jittered snowline, normal-map
    lighting, wet-attribute sea, wave normals.
  - TSL gotchas recorded: textures are graph nodes (pass to the
    factory, swap via `node.value` on rebake — `uniform(null)` does
    NOT work); `uniform()` takes THREE objects (Vector2/Color), not
    TSL constructors; `transformNormalToView` is object→view space
    (fine while the terrain mesh transform is identity — revisit if
    that changes).
  - Next: aerial-fog TSL node shared across tree/drift materials;
    `CSMShadowNode`; TSL Water/Sky with the Cox-Munk physics
    re-applied; atmosphere + cloud passes as node render-target
    passes; then the Horizon.html renderer switch and the full
    matrix.
