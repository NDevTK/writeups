# Horizon WebGPU port — engineering plan

The goal: move Horizon.html from WebGLRenderer to three.js
WebGPURenderer with the research passes (Hillaire atmosphere LUTs,
Nubis cloud march, irradiance integral) running as real compute
shaders — the way the papers themselves run.

This is a REPLACEMENT, not a parallel path: once the validation
matrix is green on WebGPURenderer, the old WebGLRenderer code
(onBeforeCompile hooks, ShaderMaterial passes, the GLSL CSM) is
deleted. Browsers without WebGPU run the SAME node code on
WebGPURenderer's WebGL2 backend — there is exactly one
implementation of every piece of physics.

## Ground rules (do not relax these to "finish" a phase)

- **No approximations to make it run.** If a subsystem cannot port
  cleanly inside a session, it stays on the working renderer until it
  can. A phase is done when the harness matrix is green, not when it
  compiles.
- **Every phase ends with the full validation matrix** (below) and,
  where the phase claims visual equivalence, a numeric A/B against the
  previous phase (mean abs pixel diff, with the stochastic
  temporal-cloud region excluded or accounted for; phase 1 measured
  3.5/255 mean with 96% of outliers in cloud sky).
- **One phase per commit series, plan updated in the same push.** The
  Status section below is the hand-off between sessions.

## Phases

1. **DONE — three r160 → r185** (commit `d001eea`). Modern three
   splits the build: `three.module.min.js` imports
   `./three.core.min.js`; both are vendored. Sky/Water/CSM examples
   re-vendored at the same tag (Water patch target strings and CSM API
   byte-checked before the swap).
2. **WebGPURenderer on its WebGL backend.** Vendor
   `build/three.webgpu.js` (+ `three.tsl.js`). `onBeforeCompile` does
   not exist there, so every material hook becomes TSL node material
   code:
   - terrain (TERRAIN_GLSL: per-pixel material from the DEM normal
     map, sea normals/spec, roughness) → `MeshStandardNodeMaterial`
     with `colorNode`/`normalNode`/`roughnessNode`
   - aerial-perspective fog hook (all world materials) → shared TSL
     fog node sampling the aerial LUT
   - CSM → `CSMShadowNode` (three has a node-based CSM)
   - Water/Sky → `WaterMesh`/`SkyMesh` from `examples/jsm/objects/`
     (TSL versions); re-apply the Cox-Munk/whitecap/surf physics as
     node code — the physics itself must not be simplified
   - atmosphere/cloud passes can initially stay as fragment-style
     passes via `TextureNode` render targets
     Acceptance: full matrix on the WebGL backend, A/B vs phase 1.
3. **WebGPU backend + compute.** Enable WebGPU (feature-detect,
   WebGL2 fallback stays):
   - transmittance / multiple-scattering / sky-view / aerial /
     irradiance LUT chain → compute shaders writing storage textures
   - Nubis march → compute at quarter res (same Bayer temporal
     reconstruction; storage-texture ping-pong)
   - irradiance readback → async staging-buffer read
     (`readRenderTargetPixelsAsync`), removing the 1 Hz sync stall
     Acceptance: matrix on WebGPU AND on the WebGL2 fallback.
4. **Post-port improvements** (each still paper-sourced): blue-noise
   march jitter (Ulichney / void-and-cluster) replacing the hash,
   sky-view LUT horizon-band fix (Bruneton parameterization near the
   horizon), motion-vector history for a translating camera if the
   free camera ever animates positionally.

## Validation matrix (offline fixture harness)

Rebuild recipe: copy the site into a scratch dir as
`site/writeups/themes/…`, rewrite the terrarium URL to local
`/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` fixtures (Grindelwald 46.62,8.04 z12 and
Nelson −41.27,173.28 z12), inject a fetch stub before the module
script that serves OSM Overpass fixtures by URL suffix and rejects
everything else (stars.json / constellations / rapier pass through to
disk), and serve with `python3 -m http.server`.

Shooting: a Node driver (playwright-core) that SPAWNS Chrome for
Testing itself (headed, under `xvfb-run`) and attaches via
`connectOverCDP`, waits for a console marker, then captures by
replaying one full frame into a `RenderTarget` in-page
(`readRenderTargetPixelsAsync`) and writing a PPM. Every piece is
forced by a measured failure — see "Real-WebGPU harness" below. The
old `--virtual-time-budget --screenshot` recipe only works for
WebGL-backend pages without async GPU readbacks; the driver replaces
it for both backends.

Determinism: animated scenes (cloud advection, water, twinkle) cannot
be A/B'd across two wall-clock runs. The harness page accepts
`pin=1[&pinstop=N]`: rAF callbacks get synthetic 60 Hz timestamps
(`performance.now` follows), `Math.random` is a seeded LCG, and at
frame N (default 600) the clock FREEZES while rAF keeps dispatching —
dt becomes 0, uTime stops, the frame is capture-time-invariant, and a
`PINSTOP` console line tells the driver to shoot. Freezing (not
stopping) rAF matters: three's WebGL-backend async readback polls its
fence via rAF, so a hard rAF stop deadlocks the capture itself.

Scenes (all at Grindelwald unless noted):

- noon clear (`cloud=25…code=2`) — aerial blues, GGX terrain, CSM
- sunset 19:10 — alpenglow from transmitted direct sun only
- night 2026-06-29T22:30 — stars, constellations, 6-px
  Lommel-Seeliger moon (flat disc, ~172–177 luminance across)
- stratus `code=3`, cumulus `code=2`, towering `code=95` decks
- Nelson sea — Water patch compiles, Cox-Munk glitter
- snowfall `temp=-3&code=73&snow=2` — Rapier loads, flakes fall
- aurora, Reykjavik winter night `aurora=0.85&auroralat=67` (an oval
  at the observer's own latitude is _correctly_ at the zenith and out
  of frame — not a bug)
- scripted free-camera flight (synthetic pointer drag + KeyW)

## Status

- Phase 1 complete (r185 vendored, matrix green, A/B 3.5/255).
- Phase 2 in progress:
  - `three.webgpu.min.js` + `three.tsl.min.js` vendored at r185;
    WebGPURenderer boots on the WebGL2 backend in the harness
    (`forceWebGL: true`, `await renderer.init()`,
    `renderer.backend.isWebGLBackend`).
  - Terrain material ported: `terrain-tsl.js` exports
    `createTerrainNodeMaterial(normalMapTex, aerialLutTex)` — the
    complete GLSL logic as node code (noise, DEM normal map,
    grass/rock/snow/sea with asinh elevation inversion,
    Pierson-Moskowitz sea normals, Blinn+Schlick glitter as
    emissiveNode, Monahan whitecaps, per-pixel roughnessNode, aerial
    LUT + Koschmieder outputNode). Unit-validated on the WebGL
    backend: altitude bands with jittered snowline, normal-map
    lighting, wet-attribute sea, wave normals.
  - TSL gotchas recorded: textures are graph nodes (pass to the
    factory, swap via `node.value` on rebake — `uniform(null)` does
    NOT work); `uniform()` takes THREE objects (Vector2/Color), not
    TSL constructors; `transformNormalToView` is object→view space
    (fine while the terrain mesh transform is identity — revisit if
    that changes).
  - Aerial fog extracted to `aerial-tsl.js` — ONE shared node graph
    (and uniforms object) applied to every world material via
    `aerial.apply(mat)`; terrain-tsl consumes it. Unit-validated on a
    scene with the terrain plus instanced conifers sharing the hook.
  - `CSMShadowNode.js` vendored (r185, node-based CSM: a shadow node
    on ONE real light — sun colour/intensity stay on that light, no
    mirrored cascade lights like the WebGL CSM). Validated in the
    same scene: per-tree soft cascade shadows on the WebGL backend.
    Usage: `sun.shadow.shadowNode = new CSMShadowNode(sun, {cascades:
3, maxFar, mode: 'practical'})`, `csm.fade = true`;
    `updateFrustums()` on resize.
  - Atmosphere ported to `atmosphere-tsl.js` — DONE and validated at
    the strongest level available: every probed texel of every LUT
    matches `atmo-reference.mjs` (an independent double-precision JS
    implementation, kept in the repo) to fp16 quantization, and the
    rendered dome is PIXEL-IDENTICAL (mean abs diff 0.0) to the
    shipped GLSL dome at the same sun/exposure. The one real bug on
    the way: nested TSL Loops both name their counter `i`, and
    outer-counter-derived EXPRESSIONS are inlined into the inner body
    where GLSL scoping makes the inner `i` win — the MS integral came
    out orders of magnitude small. Rule: `.toVar()` everything
    derived from an outer loop counter before entering an inner Loop
    (verified by a sum-probe; fixed in multiscatter + irradiance).
  - Texture-coordinate conventions on WebGPURenderer's WebGL backend,
    established by readback probes (cost a lot — do not rediscover):
    - readback rows and SCENE-geometry RT writes: GL bottom-origin
    - QuadMesh RT writes AND `texture().sample()` reads: both
      V-flipped → QuadMesh-write + sample() is SELF-CONSISTENT and is
      what atmosphere-tsl uses; scene-geometry writes must not be
      mixed into that chain; numeric readbacks of QuadMesh-written
      LUTs see flipped rows (flip j → H-1-j, texel-exact).
  - Harness gotchas (again: do not rediscover): WebGPURenderer.init()
    hangs on a DETACHED canvas (append to DOM first); interleaving
    readRenderTargetPixelsAsync with subsequent renderAsync calls
    deadlocks (batch ALL renders, then ALL readbacks); sync render()
    for offscreen passes works inside a frame but multiple top-level
    awaited renderAsync sequences can stall under
    --virtual-time-budget; readbacks of HalfFloat targets return raw
    fp16 bit patterns (decode: 15360 = 1.0); two-canvas comparison
    pages mis-size the second canvas — use one full-window page per
    renderer and diff screenshots.
  - Clouds ported to `clouds-tsl.js` — DONE at the A/B level: the
    noise physics extracted to renderer-agnostic `cloud-noise.js`
    (one definition, both implementations wrap it), the full
    temporal-reconstruction pipeline as node code (Bayer via the
    closed form 4\*((3(y&1))^(2(x&1))) + ((3((y>>1)&1))^(2((x>>1)&1)))
    instead of a const array; history reprojection with the top-origin
    uv flip at NDC conversions; depth-clamped march; nearest-depth
    composite with premultiplied blending). Deterministic warm-frame
    A/B vs the GLSL system: mean abs diff 1.25/255, residual explained
    by per-pixel jitter orientation (gl_FragCoord bottom-origin vs
    screenCoordinate top-origin) and fp. Further conventions pinned:
    depth-texture sample() is top-origin like colour; scene depth
    prepasses need no flip when sampled at uv(); Color uniforms upload
    RAW (no implicit sRGB conversion); an A/B page's scene.background
    bleeds through semi-transparent composites differently per output
    colorspace - compare over black.
  - Water ported to `water-tsl.js` — DONE at the strongest A/B level:
    full physics (Cox-Munk glitter, Monahan whitecaps, McCowan surf on
    the bathymetry texture, distorted mirror reflection) renders
    pixel-equivalent to the classic patched Water.js — mean abs diff
    0.013/255, ZERO pixels above 25, at default mirror resolutions.
    `HorizonWaterMesh` is a marked source fork of the vendored r185
    `WaterMesh.js` (node graphs cannot be string-patched). The A/B
    caught two real bugs on the way — both are the reason the
    reference-first method exists:
    - UPSTREAM three r185 `WaterMesh.js` writes
      `noise.xzy.mul( 1.5, 1.0, 1.5 )`, but TSL `mul()` chains extra
      args as scalar factors (×1.5×1.0×1.5 = ×2.25 uniformly) and
      `normalize()` cancels a uniform scale — the wave-slope
      anisotropy of classic Water.js silently vanishes and the sea
      flattens (glitter/diffuse wrong; was 8.75/255 mean). The fork
      uses `mul(vec3(1.5, 1.0, 1.5))`. Rule: NEVER pass multiple
      scalars to a TSL operator expecting a vector — construct the
      vector.
    - reflector() uv is top-origin; the classic mirror uv is
      bottom-origin, so the SAME distortion vector must be added with
      V negated or the reflection warps the opposite way vertically
      (only visible at content edges — a reflected box's waterline
      grew a tail). With both fixes: dist=0 and full-distortion A/Bs
      are both outlier-free.
    - Also pinned: WebGPURenderer honors `flipY` for loaded image
      textures exactly like WebGLRenderer (verified by a
      flip-the-reference experiment: the classic render moved AWAY
      from the TSL one when its texture was un-flipped) — no
      orientation fix-ups needed for image textures, the earlier
      QuadMesh/RT conventions are about render targets only.
  - Sky objects ported to `sky-objects-tsl.js` — DONE, strongest A/B:
    veil dome, Lommel-Seeliger moon, aurora curtains, optics dome
    (bows/halo/sundogs, both camera aims) all PIXEL-IDENTICAL
    (mean 0.000, max 0); planets identical; stars mean 0.005/255 with
    ≤1 edge pixel over threshold under active twinkle. Notes that cost
    real debugging — do not rediscover:
    - Stars/planets are instanced sprite quads (SpriteNodeMaterial +
      InstancedBufferAttribute + InstancedMesh): WebGPU has no
      gl_PointSize. scaleNode = px·2·viewZ/(screenH·P[1][1])
      reproduces gl_PointSize exactly (validated: static field has
      zero differing pixels vs gl_PointSize rendering).
    - The scintillation hash is now PCG (Jarzynski & Olano 2020) in
      BOTH implementations (Horizon.html updated): the legacy
      fract(sin(dot·43758)) hash decorrelates between shader
      compilers at fp32 — 34/400 stars twinkled with different
      phases. Integer hashing is bit-exact.
    - `vertexStage()` is load-bearing for attribute-hashing in TSL:
      node graphs evaluate in the fragment stage by default, so the
      attribute arrives through an INTERPOLATED varying and ULP-level
      interpolation noise rerolls the hash. Hash in the vertex stage,
      pass the float result through the varying.
    - TSL uint ops (bitcast/bitAnd/shiftRight/mul-wrap, >2^31
      constants) are all CORRECT on the WebGL backend — an apparent
      failure was stale `--screenshot`s of tiny single-render probe
      pages. For small probes, read back in-page
      (drawImage + getImageData) — that readback is authoritative.
    - These ShaderMaterials render RAW in the classic pipeline (no
      tonemapping/colorspace chunks, so they bypass AgX + sRGB);
      the A/B ran with LinearSRGB output on the TSL side. AT
      INTEGRATION: NodeMaterials go through the renderer output
      transform, so each of these needs the same bypass decision
      (`material.toneMapped = false` equivalent / raw outputNode) or
      the sky objects will double-transform.
  - RENDERER SWITCH LANDED (in progress): Horizon.html now boots
    WebGPURenderer (top-level `await renderer.init()`; WebGL2 backend
    fallback automatic) with ALL subsystems on the TSL ports:
    terrain-tsl, aerial-tsl, atmosphere-tsl, clouds-tsl, water-tsl,
    sky-objects-tsl, CSMShadowNode on ONE real sun light, precip as
    instanced sprites. Output architecture: the renderer runs
    NoToneMapping + LinearSRGB (identity global transform) and the
    shared aerial hooks apply AgX(0.55)+sRGB per material IN THE
    CLASSIC CHUNK ORDER (fog/aerial AFTER the encode - that is what
    shipped; `workingToColorSpace(toneMapping(AgX, exp, output.rgb))`
    reproduces classic bytes exactly, probe-validated). Raw-output
    passes (dome, sky objects, cloud composite) set no hook.
    Fixes found on the way (all repo'd):
    - RenderTarget.setSize does NOT resize an attached DepthTexture -
      recreate the RT+DepthTexture on resize or the cloud march reads
      a stale 2x2 depth (NaN-ish sceneDist).
    - OPAQUE node materials stomp output alpha to 1: the cloud march
      and the atmosphere LUT passes (aerial LUT alpha = mean
      transmittance!) need `transparent = true; blending = NoBlending`
      to write RGBA verbatim. Invisible over the black A/B background,
      fatal over a real scene - A/B over a NON-black background too.
    - Do NOT use material.premultipliedAlpha for the premultiplied
      cloud composite - that flag multiplies rgb by alpha IN-SHADER a
      second time. CustomBlending One/OneMinusSrcAlpha works fine on
      the node pipeline (the original suspicion was wrong).
    - The sprite/line pipelines do not compose opacityNode into
      `output` when an outputNode hook is set: transparent unlit
      things (precip, constellation lines, flakes) take the
      AgX+sRGB+fog chain on COLORNODE via aerial.encodeFog()/
      applyFogColor() instead of the output hook.
    - InstancedMesh with count = 0 still draws on WebGPU: gate
      `mesh.visible` (flakes/drift cluster at origin otherwise).
    - CSMShadowNode binds its camera lazily on first render: guard
      `csm.updateFrustums()` on resize until `csm.camera` exists.
    - The theme's water was NEVER added to the scene in the classic
      build (ground.remove on rebuild but no add - latent regression);
      the port restores `ground.add(water)`.
  - Validation matrix vs phase 1 (identical fixture URLs, mean abs
    diff /255): noon 2.10, night 0.93, sunset 6.04, Nelson sea 1.21,
    aurora 0.78, dome+veil under overcast 3.03 (residuals: tree sway
    phase, star twinkle, cloud wisps). Heavy-cloud deck brightness
    ROOT-CAUSED after a long hunt (deterministic subsystem A/Bs were
    EXACT at every constructed config - cumulus/stratus, mid deck,
    moving camera, dpr, interleaved passes, 300-frame loops):
    - The whole residual pinned to ambCol: pinning the cloud lighting
      uniforms equal in both builds collapses the stratus scene to
      ratio 0.99. Two components, both fixed/attributed:
      1. TRANSIENT (fixed): the async irradiance readback leaves the
         initial skyIrr GUESS in place for the first frames; the cloud
         history (8%/frame exponential blend, refresh every 16 frames)
         BAKES that bright guess in and forgets it only over hundreds
         of marched frames. Fix: cloud-system creation now waits for
         `skyIrrReady` (first readback resolved). Rule: never let a
         TEMPORAL-HISTORY system integrate lighting built on the
         async-seed guess.
      2. STEADY ~16%% (attributed): the classic GL irradiance pass
         reads (0.0088, 0.0185, 0.0403) vs TSL (0.0103, 0.0209,
         0.0444) at the same sky. The TSL irradiance LUT is validated
         per-texel against atmo-reference.mjs (double precision); the
         GL pass never was. The WebGPU build is the CORRECT one; the
         residual stratus/towering means (~16/255, concentrated in the
         deck) are the classic build's error, not the port's.
    - Also fixed on the way: frame dt is now clamped >= 0 (rAF
      timestamps are not guaranteed monotonic under every scheduler;
      a negative dt drove exponential eases out of range - uSnowy went
      negative in harness runs).
    - Snow scene: component-validated (snow cover whitens, flakes,
      precip sprites, deck = same code as stratus) but the full-scene
      A/B is harness-limited: chromium's --virtual-time-budget clock
      skips through async GPU readbacks and exhausts the budget in
      seconds of wall time on this heavier build (a pinned-interval
      injection does not stop it). Compare snow at component level or
      on real hardware.
  - LEGACY DELETION DONE — phase 2 complete. Removed: atmosphere.js,
    clouds.js, Sky.js, Water.js, CSM.js, CSMShader.js,
    three.module.min.js (the classic build; `three` now maps to the
    webgpu build). Kept: CSMFrustum.js (imported by CSMShadowNode),
    WaterMesh.js (provenance for the water-tsl fork),
    cloud-noise.js / atmo-reference.mjs (single-source physics and
    ground truth). sunTransmittanceJS moved to sun-transmittance.js.
    Post-deletion harness check: noon 2.39 / night 0.34 / Nelson 0.22
    vs the pre-deletion build (temporal randomness only). There is
    now exactly ONE implementation of every piece of physics.
- Phase 3, step 1 DONE — the full validation matrix ran on the REAL
  WebGPU backend (Dawn/SwiftShader Vulkan) in this environment and is
  green. The earlier session's verdict that this "needs a real
  browser/GPU" was WRONG — the blockers were all in the presentation/
  capture path, never in theme code. What was actually wrong, and the
  working recipe (the "Real-WebGPU harness"):
  - Headless chromium: Dawn loses its instance (`mapAsync` → "external
    Instance reference no longer exists"). HEADED under `xvfb-run`
    works.
  - ANY Playwright-LAUNCHED browser breaks Dawn the same way (default
    args, `ignoreAllDefaultArgs`, persistent context — all tried).
    The driver must `spawn()` the browser itself (plain flags:
    `--enable-unsafe-webgpu --no-sandbox --user-data-dir=…
    --remote-debugging-port=…`) and attach with `connectOverCDP`.
  - Compositor screenshots are blank for GPU surfaces under Xvfb, and
    WebGPU canvases recycle their texture on present (`toDataURL` /
    `drawImage` see stale frames). The ONLY reliable capture is an
    in-page render-target readback through three itself; the harness
    page exposes `window.__capture(w,h)` which replays one full frame
    (cloud prepass → march → main render → composite → precip
    overlay) into a fresh RT and returns
    `readRenderTargetPixelsAsync` bytes.
  - Readback row order differs: WebGL-backend readbacks are
    bottom-origin, WebGPU's top-origin — the driver normalises.
  - three r185 passes `swizzle` in GPUTextureViewDescriptor; the
    fixture chromium (Chrome for Testing 150, fetched with
    `npx @puppeteer/browsers install chrome@stable`) predates it —
    harness-only createView shim strips it.
  - SwiftShader-Vulkan throughput: most scenes ~10–30 fps; Nelson
    (planar-reflector water + cloud deck = the scene rendered twice)
    crawls at ~1.2 fps — budget ~900 s for its 600 pinned frames.
  - Results, pinned deterministic matrix at frame 600 (mean abs
    diff /255, real WebGPU vs WebGL2 backend of the SAME build):
    noon 0.005 (max 3), sunset 0.054, night 0.001 (16 star px at fp
    twinkle thresholds), stratus 0.92, towering 0.31, Nelson sea
    0.075 (glitter + twinkle points), snow 0.52, aurora 0.0003. The
    stratus/towering/snow residual is confined to
    the cloud deck (terrain rows diff exactly 0.000) and decomposes
    into: fp accumulation along the 600-frame temporal march (WGSL vs
    GLSL transcendentals), Bayer cells refreshed in the ~15
    post-freeze frames before each capture, quarter-res upsample
    edges at the terrain silhouette, and (snow) flake positions
    offset because the async Rapier wasm load lands on a different
    frame. Structure is identical throughout.
  - Subsystem pages on real WebGPU vs WebGL backend: dome 0.00,
    clouds 0.01, water 0.03 (specular-glint fp noise, no structure),
    moon/veil/aurora/optics/stars/planets 0.0000 (bit-exact). The
    clouds-tsl `coordinateSystem` clip-z branch and all QuadMesh/RT
    orientation conventions are hereby validated on WebGPU proper.
- Phase 3, step 2 DONE — compute ports. The physics stayed
  single-source: every LUT builder and the cloud march body are now
  coordinate-parameterised Fns with two thin drivers - on WebGPU a
  compute dispatch writing a StorageTexture (one invocation per
  texel, vUv at texel centres exactly matching the raster path's
  uv()); on the WebGL2 backend, which has no compute, the same Fn
  still renders through the phase-2 QuadMesh pass.
  - atmosphere-tsl.js: transmittance / multiscatter / sky-view /
    aerial LUTs are compute on WebGPU. The 1x1 irradiance stays a
    raster pass on both backends: readRenderTargetPixelsAsync IS the
    async staging read (no sync stall since phase 2), and a single
    texel gives compute nothing to win. Harness readLut() blits
    storage textures through a temp RT.
  - clouds-tsl.js: the march ping-pongs two StorageTextures via
    per-buffer kernels; history/composite consume them through the
    same swappable texture nodes as before. `pix` carries
    fragment-convention pixel centres (x+0.5) so the Bayer lattice
    and per-pixel hash are bit-identical across drivers. The
    composite remains raster (it blends into the frame).
  - Compute-primitive probe (tsl-compute-probe.html), all PASS on
    Dawn: textureStore row == sample v == readback row (no flip);
    filtered texture sampling and Loop/If inside kernels; DepthTexture
    sampling inside kernels. Also caught: WebGPU float readbacks
    narrower than 64 px come back 256-byte-row-padded (scrambled) -
    keep probe/LUT widths at w*16 bytes % 256 == 0.
  - Subsystem A/B, compute (WebGPU) vs fragment (WebGL2): dome
    0.0017 (the only >8 outliers are a 2-px band at the sky-view
    horizon seam - linear filtering across the physical discontinuity
    amplifies half-float FMA differences; the phase-4 Bruneton
    horizon-band item targets exactly this seam), clouds 0.0375
    after 64 temporal frames with max 8.
  - Full pinned matrix, WebGPU compute vs WebGL2 fragment (mean abs
    /255): noon 0.005 (a single pixel >8), sunset 0.059, night
    0.001, stratus 0.84, towering 0.32, Nelson 0.007 (max 8!), snow
    0.44, aurora 0.0003 - every scene at or better than the
    fragment-vs-fragment baseline above. Nelson's pinned run also
    got ~25% faster wall-clock (compute march).
  - Phase 3 complete.
- Phase 4, steps 1-2 DONE - horizon-band fix and blue-noise jitter.
  - Sky-view horizon fix (Bruneton). The horizon is a true radiance
    discontinuity (ground-terminated march below, full path above);
    the old mapping put it mid-texel at v=0.5 and bilinear filtering
    smeared it into the band. Now: each half-range maps to its own
    texel-centre range with half-texel guards at the seam (sqrt warp
    kept), the ray CLASS is assigned by texture half (Bruneton's
    ray_r_mu_intersects_ground - the below-boundary row marches to
    the ground at the exact tangent distance, the above row to the
    top, storing the two one-sided limits), and the dome blends the
    limits by pixel coverage (fwidth(elev)) - the box-filter integral
    of the discontinuity, which also keeps the dome continuous in
    elev so backends cannot disagree on single-pixel classification
    along the horizon row. atmo-reference.mjs mirrors the mapping;
    per-texel validation passes within ~0.1% including both guard
    rows (below 4.96e-2 vs above 8.66e-2 red - the discontinuity is
    real and now resolved crisply). Dome A/B history: pre-fix 0.0017
    with a 102-px seam band; guarded split alone 0.0102 (571 px of
    single-pixel classification flips - each backend crisp but
    disagreeing sub-pixel); with coverage blend 0.0004 and 6 px > 8.
  - Blue-noise march jitter (blue-noise.js): Ulichney's
    void-and-cluster, full algorithm (phase 0 relaxation + all three
    rank phases, toroidal Gaussian sigma 1.5, seeded LCG -
    deterministic everywhere). Verified: exact permutation,
    neighbour-threshold separation 0.41 vs white noise's 1/3. Ranks
    ship 16-bit across R/G of a 64x64 nearest/repeat DataTexture;
    marchBody's jit = fract(blueNoise(pix) + frameI * 0.618034) - the
    golden-ratio sequence stays as the temporal decorrelator, blue
    noise replaces the white sin-hash spatially. hash12 deleted.
  - Full pinned matrix (WebGPU compute vs WebGL2 fragment, /255):
    noon 0.0062, sunset 0.067, night 0.0009, stratus 0.54 (was 0.84
    - the blue noise dithers cross-compiler fp differences at high
    frequency and they cancel in the temporal average; 3.5x fewer
    >8 outliers), towering 0.33, Nelson 0.0070 (max 6), snow 0.48,
    aurora 0.0003. Sea horizon at Nelson and the alpine noon horizon
    render as crisp AA'd lines.
- Phase 4, step 3 DONE - depth-aware cloud reprojection. The camera
  translates (intro height ease, free-flight KeyW) and the fixed
  600-unit proxy point parallaxed everything not at that distance.
  - The march now outputs its CLOUD FRONT DEPTH alongside radiance:
    the coarse ranging was split into its own `slabFront` Fn (still
    runs exactly once per deck - marchSlab receives its result), the
    reconstruction became a JS builder returning {col, front} nodes,
    and the drivers route both outputs - the compute kernel stores
    into a second StorageTexture (nearest-filtered: depth must not
    blend across the cloud/sky sentinel edge), the raster driver
    writes a 2-attachment MRT RenderTarget through an Fn returning a
    TSL struct (buildMarch's If/toVar need an active build stack -
    fine inside the kernel Fn, so only the raster driver needs the
    struct wrapper; probed struct + mrt + per-attachment readback on
    the WebGL2 backend first).
  - Reprojection is Schneider's two-step: project the 600 proxy,
    read the history's front depth there, reproject through that
    distance. Rotation stays exact at any distance; sky pixels carry
    a 30000 sentinel and degrade to direction-only (exact for sky);
    reprojected pixels carry their front depth forward with their
    colour.
  - Acceptance, measured: moving-camera error vs a temporal-free
    ground truth (the clouds page's truth=1 forces a full fresh
    march every frame via the harness-only `_warm` export; identical
    deterministic camera path and jitter) dropped from 10.35 mean
    (fixed-600) to 3.95 (depth-aware), 2.6x, outlier fraction 0.29
    to 0.18 - and visibly, the deck structures register against the
    truth where the old code displaced them. Static regression:
    clouds A/B 0.0374 (unchanged), theme stratus pinned 0.547
    (unchanged within run tolerance).
  - Phase 4 complete. The port is done: one TSL implementation of
    every piece of physics, compute-driven on WebGPU, QuadMesh-driven
    on the WebGL2 fallback, reference-validated per-texel and
    matrix-validated cross-backend at every step.
- Phase 5 - ongoing state-of-the-art upgrades. Method lesson from
  the port, now standing policy: the durable ground truth is a
  double-precision CPU mirror (atmo-reference.mjs), not any previous
  GPU build - write the reference first, then the shader.
  - DONE: cloud multiple scattering by attenuated octaves (Wrenninge
    et al. 2013 "Oz"; real-time form per Hillaire, Frostbite 2016),
    replacing Schneider's Beer-powder cheat. Octave i scales
    contribution a^i, sun optical depth b^i, dual-lobe HG
    eccentricity c^i; a = b = c = 0.5, N = 3, a <= b for energy
    conservation. The legacy x18 display calibration is divided by
    sum(a^i) = 1.75 so the validated white point is preserved - the
    octave SHAPE (deep transmission, more isotropic side-lighting)
    is the physics, the constant is exposure. Deck means moved
    stratus 85->95 / towering 61->67 (multiple scattering is why a
    real overcast is not black); structure intact; cross-backend
    stratus 1.03 with the usual deck-confined fp-dither profile
    (terrain rows exactly 0, outlier tail unchanged - amplitude
    scales with the larger transmitted signal).
  - DONE: photospheric limb darkening on the sun disc, Hestroffer &
    Magnan (1998) power law I(mu) = mu^alpha with
    alpha(lambda_um) = -0.023 + 0.292/lambda at the same 680/550/440
    nm the scattering coefficients use; the disc constant is now the
    CENTRAL intensity. Dome A/B unchanged (0.0004).
  - Tessendorf FFT ocean, step 1 DONE - spectrum, reference, and the
    GPU FFT pipeline, reference-validated on BOTH backends.
    - ocean-spectrum.js (single source for reference and runtime):
      JONSWAP (Hasselmann et al. 1973 fetch relations) with the TMA
      finite-depth factor (Bouws et al. 1985, Kitaigorodskii
      scaling), Hasselmann/DHE (1980) directional spreading with the
      measured power laws and lgamma normalisation, finite-depth
      dispersion w^2 = g k tanh(kD) with the dw/dk Jacobian for the
      S(w,theta) -> S(kx,kz) change of variables, seeded Box-Muller
      h0(k). Physical sanity: Hs(U=12, F=120 km, D=60 m) = 4.02 m.
    - ocean-reference.mjs (double precision): Hermitian evolution
      h = h0(k)e^{iwt} + conj(h0(-k))e^{-iwt}, all 8 real fields
      (h, choppy Dx/Dz, spectral slopes, the 3 Jacobian derivatives),
      radix-2 IFFT; self-check max|Im| = 4.7e-15. Prints per-texel
      values incl. the exact displaced-surface normal and
      J = (1+lJxx)(1+lJzz)-(lJxz)^2.
    - ocean-tsl.js: h0/omega + butterfly LUT built once on the CPU
      (bit-reversal folded into pass 0, bottom-half twiddle signs
      folded in); per frame evolve -> 2 x log2N butterfly passes over
      two rgba32float chains (4 complex transforms packed as
      h+iDx | Dz+iSx and Sz+iJxx | Jzz+iJxz) -> unpack to a
      displacement map (lDx, h, lDz) and a derivative map
      (n.x, n.z, J) with the EXACT normal from spectral tangents.
      Project dual drivers throughout. Validated per-texel against
      the reference at t=13.7 on real WebGPU AND the WebGL2 backend
      (harness/tsl-ocean-num.html) - identical values on both.
    - New measured conventions (harness/tsl-flip-probe3.html):
      CPU DataTexture rows read STRAIGHT under .sample() on both
      backends; QuadMesh MRT write + sample self-consistent on both
      attachments; only the WebGL2 READBACK is row-flipped. Blit
      fragment outputs clamp NEGATIVE rgb at zero (positives pass) -
      numeric readbacks of signed data go through an fp32 affine
      encode. And ivec2.toFloat() collapses to a scalar - convert
      vectors with vec2()/vec3(), never .toFloat().
  - Tessendorf FFT ocean, step 2 DONE - water integration.
    - Two cascades (L = 1000 m and 120 m, N = 256), k-space
      partitioned at lambda = 25 m via exact kMin/kMax band limits in
      the h0 build - summed cascades never double-count energy. The
      unpack maps now carry COMBINABLE terms - (lDx, h, lDz, lJxz)
      and (Sx, Sz, lJxx, lJzz) - because normals and the folding
      Jacobian of a sum are not sums of per-cascade ones; the
      material sums cascade samples and builds both once.
    - water-tsl: vertex displacement (world (Dx,h,Dz) -> the rotated
      plane's local frame), the exact displaced-surface normal from
      summed spectral tangents (sampled at the UNDISPLACED parameter,
      carried by vertexStage), Jacobian-folding whitecaps with
      Jt = 0.4745 - calibrated by ocean-reference.mjs so coverage
      matches Monahan W = 3.84e-6 U^3.41 at U = 12 m/s; at every
      other wind coverage follows from the physics. The 4-octave
      scrolling-normal-map sea and the Monahan noise mask are
      DELETED; the waterNormals texture remains only for McCowan
      surf noise. Cox-Munk glitter now uses the RESIDUAL slope
      variance (total wind mss minus the cascades' exact resolved
      mss, computed as sum k^2 S dk^2 at init - Bruneton, Neyret &
      Holzschuch 2010), so sub-grid slopes are neither lost nor
      counted twice.
    - Horizon.html: cascades built with the water plane (TMA depth =
      mean of the real bathymetry, F = 150 km fixed - the weather
      API reports no fetch), advanced on REAL seconds (dispersion is
      physical), spectrum rebuilt IN PLACE via setWind() when the
      wind moves > 1.5 m/s or > 20 deg (same gating pattern as the
      aerosol LUTs; same textures/kernels, only h0 re-uploads).
      PlaneGeometry now 192x192 segments for the displacement.
    - Acceptance: pinned Nelson (28 m/s gale) on real WebGPU vs the
      WebGL2 backend: mean 0.0279, frac>8 0.00002 - green.
  - NEXT (step 3): wave FILTERING - the maps have no mip chain, so
    distant minification of the fine cascade aliases (visible as
    glitter speckle on the daytime subsystem page, amplified by the
    Blinn exponent). The paper-true fix is slope-variance-preserving
    filtering: distance-blend the fine cascade's per-pixel normal
    contribution into the BRDF roughness (the same Bruneton 2010
    variance bookkeeping already used for sub-grid slopes), or full
    LEAN/CLEAN mapping. Then a daytime-sea visual pass (glitter,
    foam at gale winds).
