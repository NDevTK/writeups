# NavigationRequest Lifecycle

This page details the lifecycle of a `NavigationRequest` and its interaction with `NavigationThrottles` and `CommitDeferringConditions`.

## Navigation States

A `NavigationRequest` goes through various states during its lifecycle:

- `NOT_STARTED`: Initial state.
- `WAITING_FOR_RENDERER_RESPONSE`: Waiting for a BeginNavigation IPC from the renderer in a browser-initiated navigation.
- `WILL_START_NAVIGATION`: Temporary state before unload handlers have run.
- `WILL_START_REQUEST`: The navigation is visible to embedders. `NavigationThrottles` run the WillStartRequest event.
- `WILL_REDIRECT_REQUEST`: The request is being redirected. `NavigationThrottles` run the WillRedirectRequest event.
- `WILL_PROCESS_RESPONSE`: The response is being processed. `NavigationThrottles` run the WillProcessResponse event.
- `WILL_COMMIT_WITHOUT_URL_LOADER`: The navigation does not require a request/response. `NavigationThrottles` run the WillCommitWithoutUrlLoader event.
- `READY_TO_COMMIT`: The browser process has asked the renderer to commit the response.
- `DID_COMMIT`: The response has been committed.
- `CANCELING`: The request is being canceled.
  This state is entered when a `NavigationThrottle` cancels the navigation, or when a critical error occurs during the navigation process.
  - **Entry points**: `CANCELING` state is entered from various states like `WILL_START_REQUEST`, `WILL_REDIRECT_REQUEST`, `WILL_PROCESS_RESPONSE`, `WILL_COMMIT_WITHOUT_URL_LOADER`, and `WILL_FAIL_REQUEST`.
  - **During this state**: In the `CANCELING` state, the `NavigationRequest` starts the cancellation process. This involves calling `OnRequestFailedInternal` to handle the failure and potentially display an error page. It also ensures that pending subframe history navigations are canceled.
  - **Transitions from `CANCELING`**: The `NavigationRequest` can transition from `CANCELING` to `READY_TO_COMMIT` (in some complex scenarios), `WILL_FAIL_REQUEST` (if failure handling needs to be re-evaluated), or remain in `CANCELING` until destruction.
- `WILL_FAIL_REQUEST`: The request is failing. `NavigationThrottles` run the WillFailRequest event.
- `DID_COMMIT_ERROR_PAGE`: The request failed with a net error code and an error page should be displayed.

## State Transitions

The `NavigationRequest` transitions between these states based on various events and conditions. The `SetState` method is used to update the state, and it includes a `DCHECK` to ensure that the state transition is valid.

## Navigation Throttles

`NavigationThrottles` can intercept the navigation at different stages (WillStartRequest, WillRedirectRequest, WillProcessResponse, WillFailRequest) and can defer, cancel, or proceed with the navigation. The `NavigationThrottleRunner` manages the execution of these throttles.

## Commit Deferring Conditions

`CommitDeferringConditions` can defer the commit of a navigation until certain conditions are met. The `CommitDeferringConditionRunner` manages the execution of these conditions.
