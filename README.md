## Themes

This website supports custom themes to change its appearance. You can select a theme using the dropdown menu in the website footer, which will set your preference for future visits. Alternatively, you can directly apply a theme for the current session by appending the `?theme=<theme-name>.css` query parameter to the URL.

For example, to use the comic theme directly via URL, you would append `?theme=comic.css`.
