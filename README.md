## Themes

This website supports custom themes to change its appearance. You can select a theme using the dropdown menu in the website footer, which will set your preference for future visits. Alternatively, you can directly apply a theme for the current session by appending the `?theme=<theme-name>.css` query parameter to the URL.

For example, to use the dark theme directly via URL, you would append `?theme=dark.css`.

### Available Themes:

Below is a list of some available themes:

*   **`default.css`**: The standard theme, offering a clean, modern, and highly readable light interface with excellent contrast and typography.
*   **`basic.css`**: A clean, minimal theme with black text on a white background, focusing on fundamental readability.
*   **`dark.css`**: A dark theme that respects your operating system's dark mode settings for body colors, with appropriately styled dark code blocks.
*   **`vibrant-light.css`**: A light and airy theme with pops of vibrant color.
